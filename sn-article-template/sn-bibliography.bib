abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that mainly affects the joints. It is characterized by synovial inflammation, which may result in cartilage and bone destruction. The present paper develops a mathematical model of chronic RA. The model is represented by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) in the synovial fluid, the synovial membrane, and the cartilage. The model characterizes the progression of the disease in terms of the degradation of the cartilage. More precisely, we assume a simplified geometry in which the synovial membrane and the cartilage are planar layers adjacent to each other. We then quantify the state of the disease by how much the cartilage layer has decreased, or, equivalently, how much the synovial layer has increased. The model is used to evaluate treatments of RA by currently used drugs, as well as by experimental drugs.}

abstract={Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an incurable systemic autoimmune disease. Disease progression leads to joint deformity and associated loss of function, which significantly impacts the quality of life for sufferers and adds to losses in the labor force. In the past few decades, RA has attracted increased attention from researchers, the abnormal signaling pathways in RA are a very important research field in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, which provides important evidence for understanding this complex disease and developing novel RA-linked intervention targets. The current review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of RA, including a general introduction to the disease, historical events, epidemiology, risk factors, and pathological process, highlight the primary research progress of the disease and various signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms, including genetic factors, epigenetic factors, summarize the most recent developments in identifying novel signaling pathways in RA and new inhibitors for treating RA. therapeutic interventions including approved drugs, clinical drugs, pre-clinical drugs, and cutting-edge therapeutic technologies. These developments will hopefully drive progress in new strategically targeted therapies and hope to provide novel ideas for RA treatment options in the future.},

abstract={Sustained clinical remission (CR) without drug treatment has not been achieved in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This implies a substantial difference between CR and the healthy state, but it has yet to be quantified. We report a longitudinal monitoring of the drug response at multi-omics levels in the peripheral blood of patients with RA. Our data reveal that drug treatments alter the molecular profile closer to that of HCs at the transcriptome, serum proteome, and immunophenotype level. Patient follow-up suggests that the molecular profile after drug treatments is associated with long-term stable CR. In addition, we identify molecular signatures that are resistant to drug treatments. These signatures are associated with RA independently of known disease severity indexes and are largely explained by the imbalance of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. This high-dimensional phenotyping provides a quantitative measure of molecular remission and illustrates a multi-omics approach to understanding drug response.},
